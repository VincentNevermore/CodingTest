# cmd line application for cursor navigating in a given gird
# To run the program, simply using the Pycharm IDE(any other IDE should also be fine) and run the main.py. The game should be pop up following the instructions as mentioned in the test

Engineer- Technical Assessment 

The candidate can use any programming language of their choice, preferably Javascript, typescript, java or Python.
This task should take no longer than 2-3 hours to complete.


Objective: Write a command-line application that navigates a cursor on a 10x10 grid.

Once the application started it needs to prompt the user for an action. Acceptable inputs are:
- `u`: move the cursor upwards 1 block
- `d`: move the cursor downwards 1 block
- `l`: move the cursor left 1 block
- `r`: move the cursor right 1 block
- `p`: print the cursor path
- `e`: exit the application


Requirements:

	For any unknown command, print the error message `Unknown command` and show the prompt again.

	The starting position must be in the top-left position of the grid (i. e. it is not possible to move upwards or leftwards as we would leave the grid boundaries).

	You should include adequate instructions on how to compile and run the application.
